# Tx (LINQ to Logs and Traces)
 
Tx allows you to do Language Integrated Query (LINQ) directly on raw event sources:

- ad-hoc query on past history in trace and log files
- standing queries on real-time feeds, such as Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) sessions

The Tx approach is different than Databases, Hadoop, Splunk, Dapper, etc. which all require a stage of uploading before the events become available to queries.

Instead, mixing Reactive Extensions (Rx) and LINQ-to-Objects allows the query to be embedded anywhere including:

- In light-weight UI tools like [LINQPad](Source/Tx.LinqPad/Readme.md)  and [SvcPerf](http://svcperf.codeplex.com)
- On original source machines, such as [Synthetic Counters](Samples/SyntheticCounters/Readme.md)


The following picture shows the dependencies among the main Tx components:

Here:

- Dark green is .Net
- Light green is mature open source
- Light grey are framework components, also available on NuGet
- Darker gray are tool experiences that come with Tx
- White are samples
